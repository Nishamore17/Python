Lambda Function:
We can define by using lambda keyword lambda n:n*n
Syntax of lambda Function: lambda argument_list : expression
Note: By using Lambda Functions we can write very concise code so that readability of the program will be improved.

Q)Write a Program to create a Lambda Function to find Square of
given Number?
1) s=lambda n:n*n
2) print("The Square of 4 is :",s(4))
3) print("The Square of 5 is :",s(5))
Output
The Square of 4 is : 16
The Square of 5 is : 25
Q) Lambda Function to find Sum of 2 given Numbers
1) s=lambda a,b:a+b
2) print("The Sum of 10,20 is:",s(10,20))
3) print("The Sum of 100,200 is:",s(100,200))
Output
The Sum of 10,20 is: 30
The Sum of 100,200 is: 300
Q) Lambda Function to find biggest of given Values
1) s=lambda a,b:a if a>b else b
2) print("The Biggest of 10,20 is:",s(10,20))
3) print("The Biggest of 100,200 is:",s(100,200))
Output
The Biggest of 10,20 is: 20
The Biggest of 100,200 is: 200
Note: Lambda Function internally returns expression value and we are not required to write return statement explicitly.
Note: Sometimes we can pass function as argument to another function. In such cases lambda functions are best choice.
We can use lambda functions very commonly with filter(), map() and reduce() functions, because these functions expect function as argument.
