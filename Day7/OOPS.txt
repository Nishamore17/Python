What is Class:
⚽ In Python every thing is an object. To create objects we required some Model or Plan or Blue print, which is nothing but class.
⚽ We can write a class to represent properties (attributes) and actions (behaviour) of object.
⚽ Properties can be represented by variables
⚽ Actions can be represented by Methods.
⚽ Hence class contains both variables and methods.

How to define a Class?
We can define a class by using class keyword.
Syntax:
class className:
''' documenttation string '''
variables:instance variables,static and local variables
methods: instance methods,static methods,class methods
Documentation string represents description of the class. Within the class doc string is
always optional. We can get doc string by using the following 2 ways.
1) print(classname.__doc__)
2) help(classname)
Example:
1) class Student:
2) ''''' This is student class with required data'''
3) print(Student.__doc__)
4) help(Student)
Within the Python class we can represent data by using variables.
There are 3 types of variables are allowed.
1) Instance Variables (Object Level Variables)
2) Static Variables (Class Level Variables)
3) Local variables (Method Level Variables)

class mypyclass:
   """This is my own class creation"""
print(mypyclass.__doc__)
help(mypyclass)

Program: Write a Python program to create a Student class and Creates an object to it.
Call the method talk() to display student details
class Student:

  def __abc__(self,name,rollno,marks):
    self.name=name
    self.rollno=rollno
    self.marks=marks

  def talk(self):
    print("Hello My Name is:",self.name)
    print("My Rollno is:",self.rollno)
    print("My Marks are:",self.marks)

s1=Student("Sai",101,80)
s1.talk()

Self Variable:
 self is the default variable which is always pointing to current object (like this keyword
in Java)
 By using self we can access instance variables and instance methods of object.
Note:
1) self should be first parameter inside constructor
def __init__(self):
2) self should be first parameter inside instance methods
def talk(self):
Constructor Concept:
☕ Constructor is a special method in python.
☕ The name of the constructor should be __init__(self)
☕ Constructor will be executed automatically at the time of object creation.
☕ The main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize instance variables.
☕ Per object constructor will be exeucted only once.
☕ Constructor can take atleast one argument(atleast self)
☕ Constructor is optional and if we are not providing any constructor then python will provide default constructor.

class Student:
  def __init__(self,x,y,z):
     self.name=x
     self.rollno=y
     self.marks=z
  def display(self):
     print("Student Name:{}\nRollno:{}\nMarks:{}".format
                                           (self.name,self.rollno,self.marks))

s1=Student("Sai",101,80)
s1.display()
s2=Student("Honey",102,100)
s2.display()
