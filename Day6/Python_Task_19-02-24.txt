1. Write a Function to check whether the given Number is Even OR Odd?

2) def f1():
3) a=777
4) print(a)
5) def f2():
6) print(a)

8) f2()

Anonymous Functions:
Sometimes we can declare a function without any name,such type of nameless
functions are called anonymous functions or lambda functions.

The main purpose of anonymous function is just for instant use(i.e for one time usage)

Lambda Function:
We can define by using lambda keyword lambda n:n*n
Syntax of lambda Function: lambda argument_list : expression
Note: By using Lambda Functions we can write very concise code so that readability of the program will be improved.

ex:
Write a Program to create a Lambda Function to find Square of given Number?
1) s=lambda n:n*n
2) print("The Square of 4 is :",s(4))
3) print("The Square of 5 is :",s(5))

TASK: CREATE Anonymous Functions FOR THE FOLLOWING

1. Lambda Function to find Sum of 2 given Numbers
2. Lambda Function to find biggest of given Values
3. Write a program to filter only Even Numbers from the List.
4. Write a program to find highest of any 3 numbers.
